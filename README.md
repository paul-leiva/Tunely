 Tunely (Lab 2 and 3) - CodePath iOS 102

## Part 1 (Lab 2)

#### Required Features: 
- [x] View a list of tracks with their title, artist and album cover in a table view using custom table view cells. (For this part of the project we’ll be using hardcoded Track data models since the goal is to focus on navigation and table views. We’ll add networking in the next unit.)

- [x] Users should be able to view the UI in any screen size and orientation. (For loading the track album cover, we'll use Nuke, a 3rd party image loading library installed via SPM.)

- [x] Tapping on a track takes the user to detail screen where they can view more information about it (artist, album, etc.).
